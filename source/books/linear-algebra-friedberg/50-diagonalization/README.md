# Diagonalization

This chapter is concerned with the so-called diagonalization problem. For a given linear operator $\mathsf{T}$ on a finite-dimensional vector space $\mathsf{V}$, we seek answers to the following questions.

1. Does there exists a basis $\beta$ for $\mathsf{V}$ such that $[\mathsf{T}]_{\beta}$ is a diagonal matrix?
2. If such a basis exists, how can it be found?
